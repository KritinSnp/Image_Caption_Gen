This project is a part of 22/23 Deep Learning module at University of Leeds.

The aim of the project is to classify the images data set and improve the accuracy by some useful techniques as following:

1. Create encoder by CNN - Image features extraction, transfer learning
2. Caption preparation - Toxenization, Corpus
3. Creater decoder by RNN
4. Examine overfitting and underfitting by train-test curve
5. Check the caption generation
6. Evaluation using BLEU score and cosine similarity
